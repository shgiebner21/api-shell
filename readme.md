# API Shell

### This package is a shell for quick, easy creation of dual-layer REST api applications


## Getting Started

> The API depends on [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) running on locally on http://127.0.0.1:5984/.  You can adjust the port number within **dal.js**, if necessary.

0. Run the following terminal commands to clone the repo from GitHub, install the project dependencies, load the data into a database named `pharma-student` and start the API on port 8080:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/shgiebner21/api-shell.git <new repo name>
    $ cd <new repo name>
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    ```

0. Open your browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to test the API.


> Any errors will be logged to the console/terminal.
